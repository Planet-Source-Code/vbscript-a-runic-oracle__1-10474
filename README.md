### Description

((UPDATE)) I have compiled the images into a resource file. Makes it a bit cleaner and a fraction faster. This program generates a simple Runic layout (Past, Present, Future) for simple divination. It uses an Access2000 DB to store the Runes' information. It is far from complete, but it works. I wrote this for a friend of mine in another city. She wanted quick access to the info on the runes. Please, leave me some suggestions. I don't really care about votes.
